**Scenario 1 – Multilinear Regression (Student Performance)**
Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
Multilinear regression was used to predict student performance using academic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors.
From the model coefficients, attendance and study hours had the greatest impact on exam scores.
Categorical features were encoded to include background effects, improving model accuracy.
Ridge and Lasso regularization stabilized coefficients and reduced overfitting.
**Scenario 2 – Polynomial Regression (Auto MPG)**
Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-datase
Polynomial regression was applied because the relationship between horsepower and MPG was non-linear.
Degree-3 polynomial gave the best performance, while degree-4 showed overfitting.
Ridge regularization smoothed the curve by reducing large coefficients.
This experiment demonstrated the bias–variance tradeoff clearly.
